# This is one of my very first projects ever outside of school. 
# I'm always playing the NYT Wordle but I'm only allowed 5 attempts a day, so I thought to myself why not make my own.
# This simple Wordle basically pulls out a random word from a list I found of 5 letter words
# and allows you to choose how many attempts you're allowed, while keeping you updated of your score every attempt.
# I would say this game is about 95% complete, feel free to try it out!
